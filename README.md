# WordPress Code Samples - Technical Overview

Pulled from a custom child theme I developed, these samples include FSE template with dynamic PHP date functionality and custom React-based Gutenberg testimonial block using modern WordPress APIs. PHP block extension safely adds responsive tablet columns to core/post-template using `WP_HTML_Tag_Processor`. Advanced SCSS features component-based carousel styling with Sass loops for scalable animations.

**Technical Decisions:** Modern WordPress 6.2+ APIs, separation of edit/save components

**Assumptions:** Modern browser support, grid-based theme utilities, editors need code-free control

**Future Improvements:** Accessibility enhancements, performance optimization, expanded the block pattern library
